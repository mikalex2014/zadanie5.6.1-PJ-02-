The bot returns the price for a certain amount of currency (euro, dollar or ruble).
When writing a bot, you need to use the pytelegrambotapi library.
The person should send a message to the bot in the form of <the name of the currency he wants to know the price of> <the name of the currency in which he wants to know the price of the first currency> <the amount of the first currency>.
When the /start or /help command is entered, the user receives instructions on how to use the bot.
When entering the /values command, information about all available currencies should be displayed in a readable form.
